Style Guide for Femshop.

Naming:
Modules: capitalized, camelCase like "CodeGenerator"
structs: capitalized, camelCase like "MeshData"
functions: lower case, underscores like "generate_code_layer"
variables: lower case, underscores like "grid_data"

Names should NOT be excessively shortened unless obvious from the context.
For example "distribution_coefficient" could be something like "distrib_coef"
but not "dc" or "dist".

Feel free to make any more suggestions on style.
